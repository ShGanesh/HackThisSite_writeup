It is overwhelmingly filled with hex 3E (>), but in between you can see 3D (=).

This likely means that its made of two *(very minutely)* different shades of the same color, so just open the file in paint or pinta and use the fill bucket on a corner to paint all surrounding 3D's into a different color (like white).
