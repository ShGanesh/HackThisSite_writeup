## Level 1
Pretty basic.  
Inspect the page and scroll away.  
Also, you should at least know about HTML before attempting further missions.  

## Level 2
Also, pretty basic.  
Since he forgot to upload the password file the value of password is naturally NULL.  
Just submit NULL.  

## Level 3
`<input type="hidden" name="file" value="password.php">`  

Go to :   
> https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/3/password.php  

## Level 4
`<input type="hidden" name="to" value="sam@hackthissite.org">`  
`<input type="submit" value="Send password to Sam">`

Since this value is manipulable just type your email address in value.

## Level 5
Similar to Level 4... strange bt worked for me...
